# Tencent Miniprogram
This was created for a 3 month Summer Competition hosted by Tencent. The goal was about designing, creating, and marketing a wechat miniprogram.
 
 Out of more than 200 teams that participated, this project was nominated to be top 8, but did not qualify for awards because the final round had to be an in person presentation.

Started out in a team of 3, but after initial planning stages both teammates had to leave due to personal reasons, so both the front and back end coding were done by myself.
